This repository provides a framework to model Large Language Models on dedicated, single-core accelerators and facilitates early identification of energy bottlenecks within the hardware architecture. It is built upon the [ZigZag](https://github.com/KULeuven-MICAS/zigzag/tree/master) Design Space Exploration tool and inherits its hardware definition format.
