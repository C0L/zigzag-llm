# ZigZag-LLM

This repository provides a framework to model Large Language Models on dedicated, single-core accelerators and facilitates early identification of energy bottlenecks within the hardware architecture. It is built upon the [ZigZag](https://github.com/KULeuven-MICAS/zigzag/tree/master) Design Space Exploration tool and inherits its hardware definition format.

## Getting started
```
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python main.py
```
